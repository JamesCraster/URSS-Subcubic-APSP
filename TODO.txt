- understand the reduction from APSP to min-plus product such that there exists T(n) algo for min-plus ==> there exists T(n) algo for APSP, 'subcubic equivalence' -> gather the necessary papers
https://wiki.epfl.ch/edicpublic/documents/Candidacy%20exam/PR13Charab.pdf DONE

- finish T.Chan's algorithm
 - get rid of copy.deepcopy() DONE
 - perform labelling only once DONE
 - test with non-square matrices
 - proof of correctness
 - proof of running time
 - get full APSP to function
 - linear median-of-medians algorithm?
