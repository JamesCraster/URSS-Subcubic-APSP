- understand the reduction from APSP to min-plus product such that there exists T(n) algo for min-plus ==> there exists T(n) algo for APSP, 'subcubic equivalence' -> gather the necessary papers

 - test with non-square matrices DONE
 - proof of correctness
 - proof of running time
 - get full APSP to function DONE
